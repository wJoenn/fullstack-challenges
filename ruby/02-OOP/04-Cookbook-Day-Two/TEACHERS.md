No lecture for today, this is Cookbook Day Two.

Start the day with a quick reminder on what the MVC architecture is and how adding a new feature to an existing MVC code impacts the code (model, then repo, then controller, then view, then router).

Since students are going to use [Nokogiri](https://nokogiri.org/) this afternoon to scrape recipes from the web, you can remind them about [our dedicated cheathseet](https://kitt.lewagon.com/knowledge/cheatsheets/nokogiri).

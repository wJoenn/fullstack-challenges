The Database & Active Record module has 4 blocks.

## `01 Schema Design & SQL`

Time to learn about relational databases, discover the different relationships between tables (`1:n`, `n:n`) and how to **draw** a database scheme. Then, we'll get started on SQL - the language used to make queries to our database structured with keywords (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `JOIN` etc.). We will start with read queries (`SELECT`).

## `02 CRUD with SQL`

Second block of SQL. First, you will get to grips with CRUD. After that, you'll learn how write in a database using few new SQL keywords (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

## `03 Active Record Basics`

Active Record is a powerful Ruby library to connect your object to a database. Active Record is one of the core library in Rails. Discover how an Active Record model is magically linked to a table thanks to a simple **naming convention**. That's Active Record magic!

## `04 Associations & Validations`

Time to go deeper into Active Record and learn about validations and associations.

### Quiz

During this fourth block, there is a short quiz on the Database module. It was designed to help you assess what you have learnt during this module. The teacher will correct the quiz in front of the class, at the end of the session.

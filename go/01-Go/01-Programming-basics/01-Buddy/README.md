## Specs

### Return your buddy's name

Open the `buddy.go`. Make sure that the method `todayMyBuddysGithubNicknameIs` does **`return`** the GitHub username of your buddy. It is different than displaying it (**`puts`**). It should return a `String`! If you don't have a buddy today, just return your own GitHub username.

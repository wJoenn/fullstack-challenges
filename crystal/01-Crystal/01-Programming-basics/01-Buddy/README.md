## Specs

### Return your buddy's name

Open the `src/buddy.cr`. Make sure that the method `today_my_buddys_github_nickname_is` does **`return`** the GitHub username of your buddy. It is different than displaying it (**`puts`**). It should return a `String`! If you don't have a buddy today, just return your own GitHub username.

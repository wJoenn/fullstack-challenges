## Specs

Find the right Go methods to plug in and make the tests pass.

Code is all about being smart and knowing how and where to look for the info you need! Often, the most difficult step is to ask google the right question. To find the methods you'll need for this challenge, use:

* Google and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
* [The Crystal doc](https://crystal-lang.org/api/1.11.2/) if you have a rough idea of the method you are looking for.

When you think you've found the method you're looking for, and you think you know how to use it, use `rake` to test this method on something!

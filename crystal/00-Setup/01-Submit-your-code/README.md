## Spec

Run `rake`. It should all be red (as you have not started coding).

Open the `src/wagon_start.cr` file in your text editor. That's where you'll need to edit the code.

- Make the `wagon_start` method return `"That's how it starts"`
- In the terminal, run `rake` and make sure you have a green result for `#wagon_start`.
- Commit your changes and push them.
